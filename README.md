**ACM Research, Fall 2021**

## Background
Malicious websites are a common and urgent threat to cybersecurity. These websites can target unsuspecting users that will infect their computer into having malware software applications. To improve the performance of malicious website detection, this project aims to provide a semi-supervised data programming method for classification.

## Purpose
In this project, members will develop a semi-supervised machine learning model to classify whether a given website URL is safe or fraudulent. Members will also utilize web scraping to extract and analyze various key elements in a website URL so that the model will discover patterns between safe and fraudulent websites. The model will be trained to recognize those various indicators of a malicious website found from web scraping.
